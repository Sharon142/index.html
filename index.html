<h1>Man-In-The-Middle Attack</h1>
<p>A Man-In-The-Middle Attack is a form of hacking done by hackers to take advantage of vulnerabilities of a Wi-Fi connection.  
   The hacker will be in the middle of a pathway between two computer users, two systems, or a computer user and system.  Hackers
   will benefit from this attack because they are able to gather information about the end-users credentials.  Man-In-The-Middle
   Attacks make up 35% of cybersecurity attacks in 2019 (most of the attacks are done using a public Wi-Fi commection).
