<h1>Man-In-The-Middle Attack</h1>
<p>A Man-In-The-Middle Attack is a form of hacking done by hackers to take advantage of vulnerabilities of a Wi-Fi connection.  
   The hacker will be in the middle of a pathway between two computer users, two systems, or a computer user and system.  Hackers
   will benefit from this attack because they are able to gather information about the end-users credentials.  Man-In-The-Middle
   Attacks make up 35% of cybersecurity attacks in 2019 (most of the attacks are done using a public Wi-Fi commection).

   Types of MITM Attacks:
   <ul>
    <li>IP Spoofing: Hackers alter the source of IP Address so that they could mask the IP address of a website or computer user</li>
    <li>DNS Spoofing: Domain names have been altered by hackers to redirect network traffic so that end-users would visit a website 
      operated by hackers.  End-users would not know this because they think they are visiting a secure and trusted website.</li>
    <li>HTTP Spoofing: The HTTP Protocol has been altered so that network traffic will be redirected to a HTTP website instead of 
      a HTTPS website.  This is done without the end-users knowledge so that cybercriminals can steal their personal information.</li>
    <li>SSL Hijacking: SSL encrypts and secures a network connection between a server and an end-user's computer.  A hacker hijacks 
      SSL by using a computer and secure server to intercept the connection and steal information from an end-user.</li>
    <li>Email Hijacking: Cybercriminals find ways to control and monitor the email connection between bank accounts.  End-users will
      receive instructions to send money to the bank but they would not know that their recipients are cybercriminals.</li>
    <li>Wi-Fi eavesdropping: Cybercriminals set up network servers or Wi-Fi hotspots that resemble nearby businesses/</li>
    <li>Session hijacking</li>
    <li>Cache poisoning</li>
  </ul>
