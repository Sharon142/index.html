<h1>Man-In-The-Middle Attack</h1>
<p>A Man-In-The-Middle Attack is a form of hacking done by hackers to take advantage of vulnerabilities of a Wi-Fi connection.  
   The hacker will be in the middle of a pathway between two computer users, two systems, or a computer user and system.  Hackers
   will benefit from this attack because they are able to gather information about the end-users credentials.  Man-In-The-Middle
   Attacks make up 35% of cybersecurity attacks in 2019 (most of the attacks are done using a public Wi-Fi commection).</p><br><br>

   <b>Types of MITM Attacks:</b>
   <ul>
    <li><b>IP Spoofing:</b> Hackers alter the source of IP Address so that they could mask the IP address of a website or computer user</li>
    <li><b>SSL Hijacking:</b> SSL encrypts and secures a network connection between a server and an end-user's computer.  A hacker hijacks 
      SSL by using a computer and secure server to intercept the connection and steal information from an end-user.</li>    
    <li><b>Wi-Fi eavesdropping:</b> Cybercriminals set up network servers or Wi-Fi hotspots that resemble nearby businesses.</li>
     <li><b>Cache poisoning:</b> Known as ARP Spoofing allows cybercriminals to eavesdrop on the network traffic route of a victim.</li>
  </ul> <br><br>
  
  <b>Examples of MITM attacks:</b>
  <ul>
   <li><b>World War II:</b> The British intelligence used MITM attacks on the Nazi forces.  The British intelligence used Aspidistra
      to send fake messages hoping it would demoralize German listeners.</li>
    <li><b>The Lenovo incident:</b> From December 2014 to January 2015, Superfish Visual search was pre-installed into Lenovo computers.
      Superfish Visual Search inserted advertisements into an end-user's traffic even though the traffic is already encrypted.  However,
      this software was removed by Windows Defender in Febuary 2015.</li>
    <li><b>Equifax's mobile application:</b>Equifax is one of the biggest credit reporting agencies that suffered a huge financial 
      data breach in 2017.  150 million American users were negatively affected by this financial breach because Equifax did not
      fix a known vulnerability.  One of the reasons is because the app did not always use HTTPS enabling their end-users to be
      vulnerable to cybercriminals.</li>    
  </ul><br><br>

  <b>Ways to prevent a MITM attack:</b> 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Secure connections:</b> Use HTTPS instead of HTTP</li>
      <li><b>VPN:</b> A VPN helps users extend their network and makes sure that the network traffic route of a user is private
        on a public server.</li>
      <li><b>Phising scams:</b> Avoid any emails that contain poor grammar, ask for sensitive information, or shortened links.</li>
